This script was written to empty my Watch Later playlist on YouTube, which had grown to >1000 videos.

It requires the new layout to work. It also has the capability to clear other playlists.  

Instructions:  
1. login to your YouTube account.  
2. access the playlist you wish to clear.  
3. open the developer console of your browser, generally you can do this with ctrl + shift + i.  
4. you may need to allow pasting, depending on your browser. if not, ignore this.  
5. copy and paste the script into the console and press enter.  

Tested in Google Chrome and Firefox.
